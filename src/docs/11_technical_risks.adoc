At this moment, we don't have any technical debt (this is our first deadline and we only have to write some documentation) but we do have risks:

|===
|Priority|Risk |Consequence | Possible Solution
|1|Not being used to the technology | Be slow at developing or make mistakes and waste time | Reading and learning about React, SOLID and RDF. We should do some tutorials and use the SOLID forum and gitter.
|2| First time forming a team| We don't know how to work with each other so we may not understand each other and consume time or be uncomfortable | Communication and interest
|3|  Not having much time | We only have 3 months to create this app and just have the course hours and some free time that we need to organize with other subjects | Organization
